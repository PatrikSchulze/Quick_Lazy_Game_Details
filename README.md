# Quick Lazy Game Details

This is a tool to easily display game related data on your stream, but it could be used for other putposes too.
If you want to display game related info or cover, as seen on the example below:

This is fairly easy to setup: You get the info and the picture and embed it all.
However if you change the game you have to do the whole process over manually.
**This tool automates all of this.**

You simple search for the title. The tool uses GiantBomb.com to aggregate the data and finds all the data you would want:
Title, release date, cover image, publisher, developer and a description.

### How to use

It's a windows executable. Open it.

Simply type in the title of the game

Its gonna take just a second

You can select where the tool should save to files to. This is where OBS will grab the files from.

This tool will create the files seen above.
For the cover you just use that image, select its path.
For text you can do the very same, use a text file instead of typing in text yourself.

Once you update the files with another game, the old files are just **overwritten** and the change of games in obs is **seamless**.

Because of GiantBomb's search algorithm, even typos are no problem.

####*If you encounter errors, its usually internet or GiantBomb related, so just try again*####
Otherwise tell me.

### Tips

In OBS you can set a custom size for text fields

This way, no matter how much text comes out as a title or description, you can just keep it within those bounds. Play around with it.

Similarly you can do this with images, like shown below and you probably will need to because covers vary in size and even shape (like long boxes)

Again just play around with it
