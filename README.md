# Quick Lazy Game Details

Quick Lazy Game Details is a tool to easily display game related data on your stream. This example shows usage with OBS.

Assume you want to display game related info or cover, as seen in the example below:

This is fairly easy to setup: You get the info and the picture and embed it all.

However if you change the game you have to do the whole process over manually.

**This tool automates all of this.**

You simply search for the title. The tool uses GiantBomb.com to aggregate the data and finds all the data you would want:
* Title
* Release date
* Cover image
* Publisher
* Developer
* Description



## How to use

It's a windows executable. Open it. 


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/exeicon.jpg "Open the app")


Simply type in the title of the game


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/searchfield.jpg "Type in your title")


Its gonna take just a second


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/findinggames.jpg "Wait")


Select the game of your choosing.

You can select where the tool should save to files to. This is where OBS will grab the files from.

Use the Update Files button to create the files for OBS.


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/update-files.jpg "Click this")


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/files.jpg "Exported files")


This tool will create the files seen above.

For the cover you just use that image, select its path.

For text you can do the very same, use a text file instead of typing in text yourself.


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/obs_textfield-details.jpg "Embed text files")


![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/obs_filepaths.jpg "Embed text files")


Once you update the files with another game, the old files are just **overwritten** and the change of games in obs is **seamless**.

Because of GiantBomb's search algorithm, even typos are no problem.

_If you encounter errors, its usually internet or GiantBomb related, so just try again_

Otherwise tell me.


### Tips

In OBS you can set a custom size for text fields

This way, no matter how much text comes out as a title or description, you can just keep it within those bounds. Play around with it.

Similarly you can do this with images, like shown below and you probably will need to because covers vary in size and even shape (like long boxes)

![alt text](https://github.com/PatrikSchulze/Quick_Lazy_Game_Details/blob/master/img/obs_image_stretch2.jpg "Image sizes")


Again just play around with it
